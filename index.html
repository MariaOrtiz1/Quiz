            <h1>&#x273F;Language of Flowers&#x273F;</h1>
                <h2>&#x273F;History of Flower Meanings&#x273F;</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph-info">The symbolic language of flowers has been recognized for centuries in many countries throughout Europe and Asia. 
                         They even play a large role in William Shakespeare’s works. 
                         Mythologies, folklore, sonnets, and plays of the ancient Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Chinese peppered with flower and plant symbolism—and for good reason.
                         Nearly every sentiment imaginable can be expressed with flowers. 
                         The orange blossom, for instance, means chastity, purity, and loveliness, while the red chrysanthemum means “I love you.”
                        <br> In the Victorian era, flowers were primarily used to deliver messages that couldn’t be spoken aloud. In a sort of silent dialogue, flowers could be used to answer “yes” or “no” questions. 
                            A “yes” answer came in the form of flowers handed over with the right hand; if the left hand was used, the answer was “no.”

                <h2>&#x273F;Presentation&#x273F;</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph-info"> How flowers were presented and in what condition were important. If the flowers were given upside down, then the idea being conveyed was the opposite of what was traditionally meant. 
                        How the ribbon was tied said something, too: Tied to the left, the flowers’ symbolism applied to the giver, whereas tied to the right, the sentiment was in reference to the recipient. 
                        And, of course, a wilted bouquet delivered an obvious message!
